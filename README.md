## Architecture

The application follows modern React patterns with a focus on maintainability and reusability:

### Component Structure
- **Atomic Components**: Small, reusable UI components in `components/ui/`
- **Feature Components**: Larger components organized by feature (e.g., `chat-scoreboard/`)
- **Layout Components**: Shared layout elements in `components/layout/`

### Custom Hooks
- `useFileUpload`: Handles file upload logic and validation
- `usePagination`: Manages pagination state and calculations
- `useSearch`: Provides search functionality with filtering
- `useChartData`: Processes chart data for different time ranges
- `useViewState`: Manages application view state

### Utilities
- `parser.ts`: Telegram export data processing
- `text-utils.ts`: Text processing utilities
- `utils.ts`: General utility functions

## Design Features

### Beautiful Header
- Sticky navigation with glassmorphism effect
- ChatRank branding with trophy icon

- Responsive design

### Glassmorphism Design

This application implements a glassmorphism design with the following characteristics:

- Frosted glass effect using backdrop-blur
- Semi-transparent backgrounds
- Subtle borders
- Soft shadows
- Depth through layering

The glassmorphism effect is achieved through Tailwind CSS classes and custom styles in the globals.css file.

### Enhanced User Experience
- Medal system for top 3 chats (ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰)
- Integrated export guide as tabs
- Better organization of content
- Improved visual hierarchy
- Advanced search and pagination
- Interactive charts with multiple time ranges

## Privacy

This application processes all data entirely in the browser. Your Telegram chat export is never uploaded to any server or stored anywhere outside your browser. After processing, the data exists only in your browser's memory and is cleared when you refresh or close the page.

Finally, let's update the main chat scoreboard import:

```typescriptreact file="components/chat-scoreboard.tsx"
[v0-no-op-code-block-prefix]export { ChatScoreboard } from './chat-scoreboard/chat-scoreboard'
